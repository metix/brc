# Brainfuck "Compiler"
this is a old fun project which I started in 2015. found it on a backup.

It converts a brainfuck program to assembly and compiles a executable.

requires
- make
- gcc

```
# compile the compiler
make

# compile a brainfuck program
./brc some-brainfuck-code.b

# run the program
./a.out
```
